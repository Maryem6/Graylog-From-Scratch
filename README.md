# Server Monitoring System using Graylog : A Graduation Project
Welcome to our graduation project repository, where we use Graylog to establish a Server Monitoring System. This project was initiated to address a critical problem faced by our company: selecting the a suitable log management solution while comparing Graylog and ELK stack which are two log management tools.
## Project Overview
To tackle this challenge, our company divided the project into two teams. One team focused on Graylog, and the other on Elasticsearch, forming a collaborative effort to gain insights into these log management tools. I worked closely with my teammate on the Graylog side, and I must admit, it was an uphill battle.

When we first started working with Graylog, Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Maven, and Linux, it felt like we were exploring unknown territory. We didn't know much about these technologies, which made things challenging. But the biggest problem we faced, was that Graylog's documentation wasn't very helpful, and there were lots of issues with the plugins we were using.
## Project Progress
During our internship, we worked really hard to build the system structure from scratch. Our efforts extended to resolving issues in existing plugins and developing new ones to enhance Graylog's functionality. This endeavor was demanding, and it tested our limits. Unfortunately, due to the constraints of our internship timeframe, we were unable to arrive at a definitive, comprehensive solution.
## Contribution to the Graylog Community
Despite the challenges we faced, we wanted to highlight how determined we were to help the Graylog community. We saw that the documentation needed to be much better, so we took the lead in trying to make it clearer and to address its inconsistency. 
In this repository, you will find the **"CookbookGraylog4-2.pdf"** a comprehensive *step-by-step tutorial that guides users through the installation and operation of Graylog 4.2*. Additionally, we have included *theoretical documentation for Graylog 2.4* in our **"GraduationInternshipReport.pdf"** report.

It's worth noting that we worked with two different Graylog versions during our internship. Initially, we utilized Graylog 4.2, but encountered dependency issues with plugins. Consequently, we decided to reconfigure our architecture using Graylog 2.4.

## Repository Contents
1. **CookbookGraylog4-2.pdf:** A user-friendly tutorial for installing and effectively utilizing Graylog 4.2.
2. **GraduationInternshipReport.pdf:** Detailed theoretical insights and documentation on Graylog 2.4.
3. **MyGraduationProjectSlides.pdf:** The slides of our project presentation.

We hope that our work proves valuable to both newcomers and seasoned users of Graylog, contributing to a better understanding of this log management tool.

**Ps: I did not post anything confidential. The cookbook is a contribution to the community**

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I greatly appreciate your interest in our graduation project.
